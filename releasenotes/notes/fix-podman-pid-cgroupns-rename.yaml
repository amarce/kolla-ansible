    Fixes container comparisons when running with Podman 4.9 or later.
    ``podman inspect`` renamed ``PidMode`` to ``PidNS`` and ``CgroupnsMode``
    to ``CgroupNS``.  Kolla Ansible now recognises both names and passes the
    correct ``--pid`` and ``--cgroupns`` options when creating containers.
