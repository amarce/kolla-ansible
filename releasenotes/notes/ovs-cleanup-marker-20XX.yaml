    The ``neutron-ovs-cleanup`` container now runs only once per host boot.
    A marker file ``/run/kolla/neutron_ovs_cleanup_done`` prevents further
    automatic executions until the host is rebooted. The container remains in
    the stopped state after completion and can be started manually if
    additional cleanup is required.
