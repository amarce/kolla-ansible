features:
  - |
    Added persistent runtime protection for ``openvswitch_vswitchd`` using the
    new ``openvswitch_vswitchd_runtime_marker_file`` marker. The marker is now
    recorded only after successful container health verification in the
    ``service-check-containers`` and ``service-start-order`` recovery paths.
  - |
    When ``openvswitch_vswitchd_protect_runtime`` is enabled and the marker
    exists, ``service-check-containers`` and ``service-start-order`` no longer
    restart or recreate ``openvswitch_vswitchd``. If the service is still
    running, restart/recreate is skipped; if it is down, the roles switch to a
    start-only recovery flow.
  - |
    Operators can override this maintenance safeguard by setting
    ``openvswitch_vswitchd_break_glass=true``.
