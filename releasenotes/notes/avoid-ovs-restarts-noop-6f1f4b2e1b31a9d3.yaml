fixes:
  - |
    ``kolla-ansible deploy`` and ``kolla-ansible reconfigure`` no longer restart
    Open vSwitch containers when the ``kolla_container`` module reports that the
    existing container configuration matches the desired state. Provider bridge
    management also honours the new ``ovs_provider_fail_mode`` variable, which
    defaults to ``standalone`` and can be set to ``secure`` when required.
