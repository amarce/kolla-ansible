features:
  - |
    The ``service-start-order`` role now detects both native Podman
    ``container-<name>.service`` units and Kolla wrapper units named
    ``kolla-<name>-container.service``. Services without a corresponding
    unit or running container are skipped, allowing staged deployments
    where some services are absent.
  - |
    The ``openvswitch`` role's post-deploy tasks now verify that the
    ``openvswitch_db`` container exists and that the service is enabled
    before attempting any configuration. This prevents failures on hosts
    where Open vSwitch is not deployed.
