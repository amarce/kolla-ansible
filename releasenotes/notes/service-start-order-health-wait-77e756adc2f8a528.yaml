    The ``service-start-order`` role now waits for each container to reach a
    running and healthy state before moving on to dependent services. The
    wait is bounded by ``kolla_service_healthcheck_retries`` and
    ``kolla_service_healthcheck_delay`` and containers already in a healthy
    state are not restarted. This prevents deployment hangs when a service
    fails to become ready.
