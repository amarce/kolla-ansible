    Fixed Podman container creation to stop passing Docker ``hostconfig``
    keywords to the Podman client. Host namespace settings such as
    ``pid_mode`` are now mapped directly to the native Podman arguments, and
    unsupported Docker-only options fail fast with a clear error message. This
    resolves ``Unknown keyword argument(s): 'hostconfig'`` failures seen during
    fresh deployments when ensuring the ``nova-libvirt`` container.
