    Adds variables ``enable_ceilometer_mongodb_external`` and
    ``ceilometer_mongodb_cluster`` allowing Ceilometer to use an
    externally managed MongoDB database. When enabled, the connection
    information is written to ``ceilometer.conf`` and the MongoDB
    backend counts as a telemetry publisher in Ceilometer prechecks.
