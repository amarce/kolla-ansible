features:
  - |
    Service start ordering now waits for dependency health checks and sets
    ``TimeoutStartSec`` via ``kolla_service_start_timeout``. A fallback delay
    ``kolla_service_no_healthcheck_wait`` controls waits for dependencies
    without health checks.
upgrade:
  - |
    Services managed by ``service-start-order`` now default to
    ``TimeoutStartSec=0`` to avoid premature start failure while waiting for
    dependencies to become healthy. Operators may adjust this with
    ``kolla_service_start_timeout``.
