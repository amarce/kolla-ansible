features:
  - |
    The ``service-start-order`` role now preserves the user-defined start
    priority when generating drop-ins and detects systemd dependency cycles
    using ``systemd-analyze verify``.
fixes:
  - |
    Resolved a bug where missing systemd units were appended out of order,
    leading to cyclic ``After``/``Requires`` chains and failed starts.
