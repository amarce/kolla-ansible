    Prevent spurious Podman container restarts when the running container
    matches the requested specification. The ``kolla_container`` module now
    inspects the full specification diff, honours explicitly provided
    parameters under newer Ansible releases, and only restarts Podman
    containers when a real change is detected or the container is not
    running. An optional idempotency assertion is available via
    ``kolla_container_idempotency_check`` to help integration tests verify
    container stability.
