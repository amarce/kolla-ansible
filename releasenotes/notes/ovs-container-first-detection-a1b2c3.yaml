    The ``service-start-order`` role now detects services based on existing
    containers rather than systemd unit files, ignoring orphaned unit files.
    When ``enable_openvswitch`` is ``true`` the role verifies that the
    ``openvswitch_db`` and ``openvswitch_vswitchd`` containers are running and
    ``ovs-vsctl --no-wait show`` succeeds before starting dependent services.
    Stale Open vSwitch units without containers no longer allow downstream
    services to start.
