    Adds a configurable ``KOLLA_POST_HEALTHY_DELAY`` (default 30 seconds)
    applied only during host boot after dependencies become healthy.
    This ensures systemd honours container start ordering. The
    ``neutron_ovs_cleanup`` service now uses a marker in
    ``/run/kolla/neutron_ovs_cleanup/done`` so it runs exactly once per
    reboot before ``neutron_openvswitch_agent`` starts.
