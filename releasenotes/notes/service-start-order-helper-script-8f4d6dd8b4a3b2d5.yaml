    The ``service-start-order`` role now uses a helper script,
    ``wait-unit-and-container-healthy.sh``, to wait for dependency units and
    container health checks instead of inlining fragile shell in systemd
    drop-ins. This resolves startup failures, honours post-healthy delays
    even when a dependency is already healthy, and removes systemd escape
    warnings.
