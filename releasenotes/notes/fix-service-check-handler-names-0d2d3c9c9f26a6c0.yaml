    Fixes the ``service-check-containers`` role so that handler notifications
    are constructed deterministically as ``Restart <service> container`` without
    relying on regex backreferences. This avoids malformed notifications such as
    ``Restart \1 container`` and adds validation that queued service names do
    not contain backslashes or bare regex group references before flushing
    handlers. This prevents reconfigure failures when services like
    ``nova-ssh`` are queued for restart while using Podman.
