    The ``service-start-order`` role now verifies that Open vSwitch services
    are present when ``enable_openvswitch`` is ``true``. Missing
    ``openvswitch_db`` or ``openvswitch_vswitchd`` containers or unit files
    cause the role to fail early instead of starting dependent containers such
    as ``neutron_openvswitch_agent`` and ``nova_libvirt``. When
    ``enable_openvswitch`` is ``false`` these services are skipped entirely.
