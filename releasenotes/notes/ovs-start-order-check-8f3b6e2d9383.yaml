    The ``service-start-order`` role now verifies that Open vSwitch services
    are present when ``enable_openvswitch`` is ``true``. Missing
    ``openvswitch_db`` or ``openvswitch_vswitchd`` units cause the role to
    fail early instead of starting dependent containers such as
    ``neutron_openvswitch_agent`` and ``nova_libvirt``. When
    ``enable_openvswitch`` is ``false`` these services are skipped entirely.
