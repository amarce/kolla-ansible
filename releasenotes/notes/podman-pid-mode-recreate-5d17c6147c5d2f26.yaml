    Fixes repeated ``pid_mode differs`` drift reports on Podman by
    passing ``--pid`` to ``podman create`` and forcing container
    recreation when immutable namespace options change.  Deployments on
    Podman 5 with cgroups v1 no longer mis-detect missing
    ``CgroupnsMode`` fields during container comparison.
