features:
  - |
    Improved Podman container comparison during ``kolla-ansible reconfigure`` by
    normalising defaults injected by the runtime. Podman-managed containers no
    longer appear changed when only ``unmask=all`` security options, reordered
    bind mounts, or empty user fields differ from the rendered specification.
upgrade:
  - |
    When ``kolla_podman_use_systemd`` is enabled, restart policy differences are
    ignored during service checks and restarts are delegated to the systemd
    units. Ensure the variable is set to ``true`` on deployments that rely on
    systemd to supervise Podman containers to benefit from the reduced
    restarts during reconfigure.
