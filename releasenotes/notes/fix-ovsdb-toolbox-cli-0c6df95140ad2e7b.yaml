    Fixes failures when running the ``openvswitch_db`` module via
    ``kolla_toolbox`` by formatting arguments in a way compatible with the
    Ansible version shipped in the toolbox container. This restores
    configuration of ``external_ids`` and ``other_config`` entries such as
    ``system-id``, ``hostname`` and ``hw-offload`` during Open vSwitch
    post-configuration.
