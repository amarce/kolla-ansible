    Fixed Podman container recreation failures introduced in PR #305 where
    the worker forwarded an unsupported ``pid`` keyword to ``podman-py``.
    The Podman backend now maps ``pid_mode`` into the format expected by the
    client, normalises the inspected PID namespace when detecting drift, and
    ignores implicit runtime users unless a service explicitly sets
    ``user``. ``cgroupns_mode`` overrides provided via ``common_options`` are
    honoured while unsupported keys continue to be stripped before reaching
    the Podman API.
