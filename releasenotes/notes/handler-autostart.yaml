features:
  - |
    Containers recreated by Ansible handlers start immediately and may
    be deferred with ``defer_start: true``. ``wait: true`` causes the module
    to wait for the container to reach a running and healthy state.
fixes:
  - |
    Added diagnostics when a container times out in ``created`` state,
    including inspect state and recent log lines.
